# Academic-Notification
A project by the Moose Party, for Umaine AASC 



The Academic and Advising Services Center has a need for an application that can allow them to quickly and effectively communicate academic progress to students. The Primary goal is to do so at 75 credit hours and 90 credit hours, but creating something that can be generated at will by staff is preferred. This is a project that has been taken on by the Moose Party in partial fulfillment of the Computer Science BS degree for the University of Maine. As the Moose Party can only take on this project over a limited period, the scope of this project needs to be somewhat limited. Ultimately a functioning prototype which operates as a proof of concept with the addition of a documented path toward future development is the stated goal.

The following developers are involved in this project: Quinn Knowles, David Kaufman, Alexa Guerrero, Jon Malcolm, and Kevin Menenello
