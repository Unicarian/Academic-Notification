Also looks at the ways in which contemporary cultural resource management by indigenous peoples serves as a key articulation of indigenous nationhood and sovereignty.  Special attention is given to recent scholarship by indigenous researchers that decolonizes standard academic practices and roots the ownership of Native cultures and research in Native communities.",

    "Description": "The purpose of the Cooperative Education/Internship program is to provide practical experiences for students that complement their academic studies and introduce them to the world of work with its corresponding professional activities.  These work-based learning experiences promote the application of theoretical knowledge and research skills acquired in the classroom to a productive and supervised experiential work site outside the formal classroom environment.  Cooperative education and internships assist students in the career development process by enabling them to examine their abilities, values, and interests while applying them to an actual career experience.One distinction between cooperative education and an internship is that co-op assignments are, more often than not, paid work experiences.  Internships usually are non-paid, volunteer assignments and are often combined with additional readings and research.  The granting of academic credit for an approved work experience is determined by the student's faculty sponsor and the university coordinator after an examination of the following criteria: nature of the work to be performed, the proposed learning objectives, the number of weeks involved, and the anticipated hours per week.  (Note:  Students must generally work 70 hours for each credit earned, but these hours must be relevant to the stated learning objectives.)  Students must apply to the coordinator for cooperative education/internship before registering for the class.  It is strongly recommended that planning and application for all cooperative education and internship experiences begin during the semester prior to participation.  Many fields of study require as a condition of graduation the completion of one or more training programs or courses in an outside clinical or professional setting, such as a hospital, clinic, professional office, or public classroom.  These outside institutions, offices, and schools that provide the environmental opportunities to students sometimes impose additional requirements as conditions of participation in their programs.  Such requirements might include evidence of a recent medical examination; evidence of health, auto or other insurance; a written agreement to personally accept and abide by the rules and regulations of that institution; the execution of an indemnity agreement or release relative to personal liability or liability to others; and similar requirements pertinent to the particular study program.  The University assumes assent and compliance to such requirements, rules, and regulations by each student upon his or her enrollment in those courses involving outside study.

Students will study a series of games that capture various aspects of strategic interaction - including well-known games such as Prisoner's Dilemmas, Arms Races, Auctions, and Voting Mechanisms. Each game will be motivated by a common problem faced by decision-makers in the real world. Students will play versions of each game for themselves and analyze outcomes from similar games in the real world. Students will then use the tools of economics and game theory to study how behavior is influenced by the nature of the game itself, such as available information, beliefs about other players, and the interrelatedness of outcomes.",

The course also integrates new literature on the evolution of cooperation and multilevel selection to provide a solid mechanistic model of the dynamics of institutions, economies and societies.  The course covers historical and current evolutionary approaches to economics and students will learn how an evolutionary approach connects to the other social sciences.  We study emergence of social and economics adaptations of individuals, governments, corporations and other organizations.  Students build evolutionary accounts of economic systems, characterize evolutionary forces acting in economic systems, suggest interventions to improve outcomes.  Students complete a major project on an evolving economic system of their choosing.

    "Title": "Col & Early National Amer Lit",
    "Description": "The literatures of colonial America began almost immediately after contact between Europeans and Native Americans in the fifteenth century, disseminated in multiple languages across Europe.  These earliest writings were advertisements for empire: tales of adventure, catalogues of wonders, justifications and warnings.  By the seventeenth century, new immigrants and Amercian-born settlers were creating a local literature for local consumption, including the great devotional works of the New England Puritans and the first examples of that long-lived American genre, the captivity narrative.  This colonial period culminated in the eighteenth century's American Enlightenment, which gave rise to the Revolution, and was soon followed by the first stirrings of literary nationalism in the early republic.  Encompassing three hundred years of history and an international range of authors, this introductory course may include works translated into English and taking such representative forms as the memoir, travel narrative, sermon, and political tract, as well as the more expected literary genres of poetry, fiction, and drama.  A reading-intensive course, it is designed to teach students about a crucial epoch in world history and American literature while creating an opportunity for students to practice reading and research skills in order to better prepare them for work in advanced seminars.",

Yet Jack Kerouac was the son of French Canadian immigrants, spoke only French until he was six, wrote an early draft of his famous On the Road in French, sprinkled passages in French throughout all his writing and cited French writers as important inspirations.  This course will explore the ways in which Kerouac straddle cultures and how this transnationalism infects, determines and interrupts both the content and the style of his writings.  We will read excerpts of Kerouac's lesser-known writings, some of his writings in French (in translation) and of course parts of On the Road.  This class will run as a seminar; no prior knowledge of French is required.",

This course considers the interplay between cultural traditions and modernity.  The regional scope highlights local developments.  We will investigate  prominent themes of resistance, accommodation, activism, sovereignty, and cultural survival.  Wabanaki people were positive actors in their own affairs, not passive pawns subdued by forces beyond their control. This course will provide context to contemporary challenges Wabanaki people confront.

The tribal homeland encompasses present-day northern New England, the Maritime Provinces, and southern Quebec.  We will explore the variety of ways Wabanaki experiences deviated from the national narrative on American Indians and examine when Native challenges were in lockstep with western tribes in the twentieth century.  This course considers the interplay between cultural traditions and modernity.  The regional scope highlights local developments.  We will investigate  prominent themes of resistance, accommodation, activism, sovereignty, and cultural survival.  Wabanaki people were positive actors in their own affairs, not passive pawns subdued by forces beyond their control. This course will provide context to contemporary challenges Wabanaki people confront.

The course will explore five major areas of shark biology and the current challenges to sharks in the modern world; shark evolution, shark ecology, shark physiology, shark behavior and shark fisheries.  We will also look at the current pressures humans exert on sharks, particularly those caused by overfishing, and the issues surrounding captive sharks in public aquaria.  By the end of the course, the students should have a sound understanding of how sharks are adapted to their environments and why they have remained one of the most successful groups of vertebrates over the last 420 million years.\n\nIf this course was taken as a topics course in SMS 491, it cannot be repeated for credit",

Viruses and their role in evolution of microbes and nutrient cycling in the ocean are discussed.  Basic molecular information is integrated into understanding evolutionary processes and mechanism of microbial interaction with higher organisms, symbiotic and pathogenic in the marine environment.  Microbes in extreme environments are explored to demonstrate how molecular and cellular adaptations play out in different marine environments. Biochemical and microbial processes that are critical to the maintenance and function of the biosphere are examined, with examples from marine environments. Overall, students in this course will learn how to ingrate across different spatial scales, from molecules to ecosystems, and approaches, from cellular biology to evolution.",

    "Title": "Ecol & Mngmt Game Birds",
    "Description": "This course provides a broad survey of topics relevant to the ecology and management of the ducks, geese, grouse, quail, and woodcock that are native to North America - species we typically consider \"Game Birds\" because of their popularity for human harvest.  We'll place particular emphasis on species that regularly occur in Maine.  In doing so we will cover a number of areas related to avian biology in general, including taxonomy, physiology, behavior, and species\u00bf conservation, and will synthesize across subjects that are relevant to wildlife ecology as a whole.  The course content will include a mix of lectures, class discussions, group and independent projects, and field trips.  This class is designed to meet the University requirement as a writing intensive general elective, and will means that you will required to complete a major written project as a component of the course and will receive feedback on your writing and have the opportunity to revise your work. One weekend field trip will be required.",
